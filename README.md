# BC125Py

A Python-based interface for the Uniden BC125AT radio scanner.

This project aims to be a Linux replacement for the Windows-only
Uniden software for the BC125AT. Presently, BC125Py only has a
command line interface, but a GUI is planned. Rest assured, the
CLI is not hard to use at all!

# Installation

`pip install bc125py`
